        <h2>Impacts</h2>
        <p>Taking the SAT or/and ACT has always played an important role in determining whether students get into their desired college. However, in the recent years, many colleges are going test-optional or not looking at the scores at all. What impacts does this have on students relying on test scores versus ones who relied on extracurriculars?</p>
        <h5 class="accepting">Accepting Test Scores</h5>
        <ul class="pros">
            <li>Easier comparison in scores</li>
            <li>Compares academic level</li>
            <li>Scholarships/Grants</li>
            <li>Shows level of interest for academic preparation</li>
            <li>Readiness for college workload</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="removed">Test blind</h5>
        <ul class="blind">
            <li>Do not have to pay to take SAT/ACT</li>
            <li>Focus shifts to extracurriculars</li>
            <li>More time for passion projects</li>
            <li>Not correlated to college success/corrupted</li>
            <li>Reduced competitiveness in academic scores</li>
            <li>Low scores do not impact college admissions</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="there">Test Optional</h5>
        <p class="optional">Test optional seems to be a bit more complex topic. Even though some colleges have declared tests are optional, there are still millions of students submitting test scores. However, these scores are not to be looked at for admissions. Getting a good score lets students qualify for scholarships. It is said that colleges will "not penalize students for the absence of a standardized test score" but that does not mean that not submitting a score will give you a higher chance of getting in. Simply comparing Student A who has a score of 1570 and a 4.0 GPA with Student B who took almost the same courses and also has a 4.0 GPA, but not a test score, will give Student A a simple advantage. Even though scores are meant for getting scholarships, seeing a 1570 on an application looks strong academically, with admission couselors inclined to vouch for Student A more. </p>
