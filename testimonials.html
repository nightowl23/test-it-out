        <p class="user">"Our users told us they were not aware of such details beforehand and needed to hire a professional to require this information. After they visited our website, majority of their time was saved! Everything was where they needed it to be and learned about going test-blind and whether they should take the SAT or ACT!"</p>
        
        <p class="friend">"My friend accessed this website and found that she can save money by not paying for these exams! She used that money to buy prep books for her AP exams and resources to learn more about her passion!"</p>
        
        <p class="highschooler">"Another highschooler left us a comment thanking us for raising awareness and telling others that SAT and ACT are not mandatory. This information was not accessible to everyone nor easy to find, but after he used this website, he recommended it to more people and they are applying using the test-blind pathway!"</p>

        <p class="louis">"Louis's friend told him that navigating the website was super easy and he learned that the SAT, mostly because of collegeboard, is corrupted! He realized not to stress about taking the ACT either since the colleges he was applying to did not require it. He contacted and us and told us that he saved thousands of dollars by not hiring a counselor due to this website.</p>
