        <p class="user">"I was not aware of such details beforehand and needed to hire a professional to acquire this information. After I visited this website, majority of my time was saved! Everything was where I needed it to be and learned about going test-blind and whether I should take the SAT or ACT!"</p>
        
        <p class="friend">"I accessed this website and found that I can save money by not paying for these exams! I used that money to buy prep books for my AP exams and resources to learn more about her passion!"</p>
        
        <p class="highschooler">"I left a comment thanking Louis and Anshika for raising awareness and telling others that SAT and ACT are not mandatory. This information was not accessible to everyone nor easy to find, but after I used this website, I recommended it to more people and they are applying using the test-blind pathway!"</p>

        <p class="louis">"I said that navigating the website was super easy and learned that the SAT, mostly because of collegeboard, is corrupted! I realized not to stress about taking the ACT either since the colleges I was applying to did not require it. I saved thousands of dollars by not hiring a counselor due to this website. Thank you!"</p>
